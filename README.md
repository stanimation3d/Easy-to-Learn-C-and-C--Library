# Easy-to-Learn C/C++ Library
This is an additional library developed by Sahne DÃ¼nya that makes using the Standard C/C++ Library easier. The goal of this library is to create an interesting product. This library adds a readable additional function that simplifies the use of functions in the Standard C Library header files, which require programming knowledge. In other words, it wasn't entirely written from scratch, but what's even more interesting is that it directly explains what the functions do, eliminating the need for a user manual. Not only does it explain the meaning of the words used in classical English, but they are also used more frequently. This is an advantage if English is not your native language.
